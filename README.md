## FAQ

### Where does the data come from?

The data is all sourced from [wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org).

### I was played a card that doesn't make sense - what gives?

There are some cards that unfortunately don't quite make sense or have bad data. These need to be removed from the game and, ideally, to have their underlying wikidata entry fixed.

Please report any bad cards here: https://github.com/EdwardTheLegend/wikitrivia/discussions/2.
